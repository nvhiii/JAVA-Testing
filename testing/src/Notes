/*
Instance method - needs an object of class to be created before getting called
                + need to create object for this, thus often has no args

Static methods - can just be called without creation of object
                + cannot create object for this method type !!!
                + usually has args!!
                + also has the keyword STATIC

Instance data fields - often are just data type followed by var = value !!

Public modifiers, private modifiers, protected modifiers & Packages

Packages - are called using
           [ package "PackageName"; ]

           If class is defined w/o package stmnt, it is in default package

Public modifiers - Allows for access of member from inside and outside pkg

Private modifiers - Allows for access of data fields in own class

Protected modifiers - Allows for access of member in its own package

If you want users to be prohibited from creating in a certain class,
make the constructor private! (usually should be public)

Data Field Encapsulation - to prevent direct modifications of data fields,
declare data fields private using the private modifier!!

Often, you need to retrieve and modify data fields, this is accomplished
with private by using a getter method.

e.g.
    public returnType getPropertyName(); // accessor

    public boolean isPropertyName(); // e.g. of a boolean accessor

setter e.g.
    public void setPropertyName(dataType propertyValue)


Array of Objects

Syntax:
    Circle[] circleArray = new Circle[10];

    // this stmnt declares and creates an array of 10 circle objects
   to initialize, you can use a for loop

   for (int i = 0; i < circleArray.length; i++) {
    circleArray[i] = new Circle();

*when array of objects created using new operator, each element in array is
ref variable with default value null

**printf is print formatting**
    - can check formatting documentation whilst using printf, useful for formatting

Immutable Objects & Classes
    - occassionally it is desirable to create an object whose contents cannot be changed once object is created
        - "immutable" class & object
    - if class is immutable, all data fields must be private w/ no public setter methods

Variable Scope

This key-word to reference data fields

Thinking in Objects

Class Relationships

Association
    - relations implemented using data fields
    **different classes access another class which they share in common**

Aggregation
    - may exist between objects of same class

    e.g.
    public class Person {

    private Person supervisor;

    }


    }

Designing Class for Stacks - 10/3 --> 10/4

public keyword - declare's member's access as public

static keyword - used to share same var or method of given class (mostly for memory management)

void keyword - denotes that a method does not have a return type

API - application programming interface (offering service to other software)

Processing Primitive Data Type Values as Objects

    - primitive data type values are not objects
    (wrapping data type into object)
    e.g.
        - int to Integer
        - double to Double
        - char to Character
Using these wrapper classes, you can process primitive data types as objects
    e.g. of Wrapper classes in java.lang package
    - Boolean
    - Character
    - Double
    - Float
    - Byte
    - Short
    - Integer
    - Long

Each of these numeric wrapper classes contain a method to "convert" objects into primitive types"
    e.g.
    doubleValue(), floatValue(), intValue(), longValue(), shortValue(), byteValue()

Can construct wrapper object from primitive data type or from string
    e.g.
    new Double(5.0) = new Double("5.0")

Instances of wrapper classes are immutable, meaning once the objects are created, their values cannot be changed

Each numeric wrapper class has MAX_VALUE(Byte, Short, Integer, and Long)
Each numeric wrapper class has MIN_VALUE
    **MIN_VALUE shows minimum from byte, short, int, and long
    **MIN_value shows minimum POSITIVE float and double

Each numeric wrapper class contains doubleValue(), floatValue(), intValue(), longValue(), and shortValue()
    - returns double, float, int, long, or short
